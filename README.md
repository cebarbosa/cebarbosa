### Hi there, I am CarlosðŸ‘‹

I am Carlos, a data scientist at Global Hitss in SÃ£o Paulo, where I develop data analysis and machine learning models to support strategic business decisions and to optimize internal processes using big data.

I am also a professional astronomer who formely worked in scientific research for ten years (including a master's degree, a PhD and post-docs) where I studied the structure of galaxies from observational data, with the goal of understanding how they formed and evolved over time.
